# Gmail RSS
## What is this doing?
It'll just check your Gmail every 10 minutes and notify about new messages. 
## Downloading
For install you need just to drag and drop `Gmail RSS.crx` file in your browser.
## For what this?
I created this to fix my problem with notifications of my 
 messages.
I published it, cause someone can get same problem and it can help you, until you're going to update your browser.
